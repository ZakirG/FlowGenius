\f0\fs20 \cf2 app idea: 
\fs28 Mac Stickies research agent. it watches your messy thoughts and researches solutions and advice for you. 
\f1\b app that embeds all your stickies in RAG and sees you typing in a new sticky and then finds relevant portions from other stickies of yours
\f0\b0  to remind you of old things that you wrote. but how would i integrate LangGraph? it shows up in the UI automatically when a sticky is focused, and then disppears when you switch away.\
\
if i built this how long would it take?\
\
i wonder if i could get the latency down pretty low}
